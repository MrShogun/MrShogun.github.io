## Last Week's Summary: Adding Achievement Information

This week I continued work on my academic business card website by adding information about my skills, experience, and accomplishments. The following tasks were completed as part of the work:

1. **Addition of skills information (Skills)**: 
   I added a section to the website that lists my main professional and technical skills. This includes proficiency in programming languages, data analysis tools, academic knowledge and scientific methods.

2. **Addition of Experience (Experience)**: 
   I have also added a description of my professional and academic experience, including participation in research projects, grants, and publication of articles in international journals.

3. **Addition of Accomplishments (Accomplishments)**: 
   In this section, I have indicated my key achievements, such as winning academic competitions and Olympiads, and participating in international conferences and workshops.

4. **Publishing a post on the second week of the project**: 
   I wrote a post summarising the results of the second week of work on the academic business card website project. It describes the main steps in adding the achievements and experience sections.

5. **Added a post on ‘Markup Languages. LaTeX ‘**: 
   As part of this week's topic, I wrote a post about the **LaTeX** markup language, which is widely used to create scientific and technical documents. The post covers the main benefits of LaTeX and its use for formatting mathematical formulae and creating professional publications.

In summary, the site has grown considerably with the addition of new sections and content, making it more comprehensive and informative. Next week I plan to continue its development and improvement.
