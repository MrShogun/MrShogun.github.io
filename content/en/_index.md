        I focus on applied mathematics and telecommunications, particularly in the areas of queueing theory, stochastic modeling, and teletraffic systems. My work includes developing mathematical models for analyzing network performance, optimizing system processes, and solving real-world telecommunication challenges. I actively collaborate with other researchers and participate in international conferences to present findings and share insights.

        Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on mathematical theory applications and system optimization.
