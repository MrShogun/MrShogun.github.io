title: SMARTY-2024 Conference participation

event: The Fourth International Workshop on Stochastic Modeling and Applied Research of Technology (SMARTY 2024)
event_url: http://smarty24.karelia.website/#

location: Karelian Research Center of RAS
address:
  street: 11, Pushkinskaya Str.
  city: Petrozavodsk

  postcode: '185000'
  country: Russia

summary: Participated in an international conference with a report on the results of my research.
abstract: SMARTY workshop is an established biannual series of events that aim to bring together researchers working on the theoretical, algorithmic and methodological aspects of queueing theory, stochastic modeling and applied probability, focusing on applications of such methods across a broad spectrum of technical systems with primary interest in high-performance and distributed computing systems and, recently, modern computing trends such as quantum computing. **Key focus:** SMARTY 2024 sets up a working environment to share recent results on 1. stability and performance issues of stochastic models of high-performance and distributed computing systems, as well as other modern technologies; 2. simulation, estimation, and subtle techniques of stochastic modeling and analysis applied to various computing and communication systems.
