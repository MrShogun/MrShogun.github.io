## Markup Languages: LaTeX

### What is LaTeX?

**LaTeX** is a markup system for producing high quality documents, especially widely used in scientific and academic circles. LaTeX allows you to work efficiently with text, mathematical formulae, tables, images and links, while ensuring that your document is strictly formatted and structured.

LaTeX (pronounced ‘Lateh’) is based on the **TeX** computer layout system developed by Donald Knuth in the late 1970s. LaTeX automates many aspects of formatting, which makes it particularly useful for preparing large documents --- books, dissertations, and scientific articles.

The basic idea behind LaTeX is that the author focuses on the content rather than the layout of the text. The formatting and layout of the document is done automatically by LaTeX based on markup commands.

### Advantages of using LaTeX

1. **Quality of typography**: LaTeX generates documents with professional typography, which is especially important for academic publications.
2. **Working with mathematical formulae**: LaTeX provides powerful tools for displaying complex mathematical expressions.
3. **Comfortable working with large documents**: LaTeX is ideal for writing theses, dissertations, scientific articles and books, thanks to its support for splitting your document into chapters, sections and subsections.
4. **Automation of references and bibliographies**: LaTeX automatically creates links to tables, figures, and bibliographies, making it easy to work with sources.
5. **Flexibility and Extensibility**: With a wide variety of packages available, LaTeX can be adapted for a wide range of tasks, from resume writing to scientific publications.

### Basic Elements of LaTeX

- **Text and Formatting**: Standard text elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists are easily created using LaTeX commands.
- **Mathematical Formulas**: LaTeX supports a wide range of mathematical symbols and operators, making it indispensable for mathematicians, physicists and engineers.
  ``latex
  \begin{equation}
  E = mc^2
  \end{equation}
  ```
This code generates Einstein's famous formula for energy.
- **References and Bibliography:** The use of packages such as `biblatex` makes it easy to manage the bibliography and automatically create a reference list.
- **Typography:** The LaTeX toolkit provides extensive facilities for typographic preparation of the final document. 

### Where is LaTeX used?

LaTeX is often used in academic environments to create:

- Research articles and reports;
- Dissertations and theses;
- Books and monographs;
- Presentations (using the Beamer package);
- Resumes, CVs and other documents that require strictly structured and aesthetically pleasing design.

### Tools for working with LaTeX

There are various editors for working with LaTeX that simplify the process of creating documents:

- **Overleaf** --- an online platform for collaborating on LaTeX documents.
- **TeXShop** and **TeXworks** --- popular editors for macOS and Windows.
- **MikTeX** and **TeX Live** --- LaTeX distributions for working locally on your computer.


### Why Learn LaTeX

LaTeX is the de facto standard for scientific publications in fields such as physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. Knowledge of LaTeX helps you avoid formatting problems, makes your documents more efficient, and allows you to focus on content rather than layout.

If you are a scientist or plan to publish your work in academic journals, mastering LaTeX will be an important skill in your professional career.
