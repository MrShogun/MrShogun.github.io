## Last week's results: Adding links to scholarly and bibliometric resources

This week I continued to develop my academic business card site by adding links to key scholarly and bibliometric resources, as well as writing a new post on the topic of working with bibliographies. The following tasks were completed as part of the work:

1. **Registration on scholarly and bibliometric platforms**: 
   To increase academic visibility and facilitate access to my publications, I registered on the following platforms:
   
   - [eLibrary](https://elibrary.ru/)
   - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
   - [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)
   - [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
   - [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/)
   - [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/)
   - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/)

2. **Posting links on the site**: 
   After registering, I added links to my profile on each of these platforms in the appropriate section of the site. This will allow site visitors to easily find my research publications, projects, and other information.

3. **Publishing a post on the third week of the project**: 
   I have written a post summarising the results of the third week of work on the academic business card website project. This post outlines the steps involved in registering on academic platforms and adding links to them.

4. **Added a post on ‘Working with Bibliographies ’**: 
   As part of the topic content, I have published a new post on working with bibliographies. In this post, I discussed the importance of proper citation of sources in scholarly publications, gave examples of bibliography tools such as **BibTeX**, **Zotero**, **Mendeley**, **EndNote**, and showed how to use bibliography in LaTeX.

In summary, this week the site was updated with important resources for academic endeavours that will allow readers to more easily find my work and publications across platforms. In the coming week, I plan to continue improving the site and converting it to a bilingual form --- English and Russian versions.
