## Working with bibliography

In scientific and academic papers, proper handling of bibliography is an important element of design. A bibliography helps to indicate the sources that were used in the preparation of an article, thesis, or any other research, and allows readers to quickly find and consult them.

### Why do I need a bibliography?

A bibliography fulfils several key functions:

- **Acknowledgement of credibility of data**: Citing authoritative sources shows that your research is based on verified data.
- **Plagiarism Avoidance**: Proper citation helps you avoid accusations of plagiarism because you correctly cite authors and sources of ideas borrowed in your work.
- **Finding Additional Information**: Readers can use your bibliography to find more information on a topic.

### Tools for working with bibliographies

There are various tools that simplify the process of managing and formatting bibliographic data:

- **BibTeX**: This is one of the most popular tools for working with bibliographies in LaTeX. BibTeX allows you to automatically insert bibliographic references and manage the formatting of the reference list.
- **Zotero**: This is a free bibliography management application that allows you to save references, articles, and books and then automatically generate a bibliography in a variety of styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).
- **Mendeley**: Similar to Zotero, this is a bibliography and scholarly article manager with bibliography sharing and integration with word processors.
- **EndNote**: One of the most powerful commercial tools for managing reference lists, widely used in academia and research.

### Bibliography standards and styles

There are several basic bibliography design styles that depend on the requirements of a particular discipline or publisher. Here are some common styles:

- **APA (American Psychological Association)** --- often used in the social sciences and psychology.
- **MLA (Modern Language Association)** --- used in the humanities.
- **Chicago** --- a universal style often used in books and articles on history and literature.
- **IEEE** --- popular in engineering and technical disciplines.

### Example of using Bibliography in LaTeX

Here is an example of how you can use BibTeX to automatically create a reference list in LaTeX:

``latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{cite}

\begin{document}

\section{introduction}

The importance of scientific publications has been discussed in \cite{knuth1974tex} and \cite{lamport1994latex}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}.
\bibliography{references}

\end{document}
```

Where the ``references.bib`` file may look like this:

```bibtex
@book{knuth1974tex,
  title={The TeXbook}
  author={Knuth, Donald E},
  year={1974},
  publisher={Addison-Wesley}
}

@book{lamport1994latex,
  title={LaTeX: A Document Preparation System},
  author={Lamport, Leslie},
  year={1994},
  publisher={Addison-Wesley}
}
```

### Conclusion

Working with a bibliography --- an important part of academic work. Using tools to manage reference lists can greatly simplify the process of preparing research articles, dissertations, and other works. Regardless of the tool you choose, a proper bibliography is the key to a successful and correct academic publication.
