## Last week's results: Adding data to the site

This week I continued work on my academic business card site, adding key information about myself to the site and continuing to fill it with content. The following tasks were completed in the process:

1. **Posting a photo**: 
   I added a photograph to the home page of the site to make it more personalised and improve the visual experience.

2. **Addition of a brief description (Biography)**: 
   The site now has a brief description about me, which includes information about my research articles, participation in conferences, and winning competitions and competitions.

3. **Addition of Interests**: 
   I have indicated my main interests such as maths, computer science, telecommunications and sports to better reflect my hobbies and professional areas.

4. **Addition of Education (Education)**: 
   Information about my completed Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science has been added to the Education section.

5. **Publishing a post on the first week of the project**: 
   I wrote a post describing the first steps in creating a website: installing the necessary software, selecting and downloading a template, setting up GitHub Pages, and posting a website preset.

6. **Added a post on Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: 
   I also wrote a post explaining the key concepts of CI/CD, their benefits and importance to modern development processes.

The site has thus become a complete business card with basic data about me and initial content. In the coming weeks I plan to further develop it and fill the site with new content.
