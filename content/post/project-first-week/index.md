## Last Week's Summary: Hosting a Personal Website Billet

This past week I completed the important steps of creating and hosting my personal website on the **Github Pages** platform. The following tasks were completed in the process:

1. **Installation of required software**: 
   I installed all the necessary tools, including Git and the Visual Studio Code text editor, to successfully complete the project.

2. **Downloading the website template**: 
   I selected and downloaded a suitable HugoBoss template to create a business card website, which is well suited for an academic portfolio.

3. **Posting the template on GitHub**: 
   After customising and editing the template, I uploaded it to a repository on GitHub and set up hosting via **Github Pages**.

4. **Customising the site URL**: 
   A custom URL for the site was set up for easier access, ensuring the content was displayed correctly.

5. **Publishing the site preset**: 
   After all the customisations and checks, the billet of my personal website has been successfully hosted and made available online.

The site is now ready for further content and can be used as a platform to showcase my academic achievements, projects and research.
