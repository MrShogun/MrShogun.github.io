abstract: In this paper, a polling service model is used for performance analysis
  of a leaf node in an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) network. is constructed
  in order to analyse the performance measures of the system, which will enable the
  estimation of packet transmission delays in an IAB network. The Markovian polling
  queueing system with two queues and nonzero switching time is constructed to analyse
  the performance measures of the system, which will enable the estimation of packet
  transmission delays in an IAB network. One of the queues is designed to store packets
  transmitted in downlink from a parent node in the IAB network, and the second queue
  is designed to store packets transmitted in uplink from child nodes and user equipment
  associated with an analyzed node. Cyclic polling of queues allows to take into account
  the main feature of IAB technology --- half--duplex mode of packet transmission.
  Using the apparatus of Markov processes, formulas for calculating the waiting time
  and the sojourn time of the request in the system, affecting the delay of packet
  transmission through the node, are obtained. The results of the numerical analysis
  illustrate an upper bound estimate for the server switching time at which the 5G
  NR delay constraints are fulfilled for networks with a single relay node.
