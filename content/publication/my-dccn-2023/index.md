abstract: The presented research analyzes the probabilistic characteristics of the
  Integrated Access and Backhaul system developed by the 3GPP consortium for millimeter-wave
  wireless networks. This technology addresses the challenges of deploying mobile
  base stations including those on UAV in densely populated urban areas with high
  building density and the presence of both mobile and stationary radio signal blockers.
  The study encompasses the development of a model and scenario for IAB implementation,
  a GPSS simulator, and an analytical model of a system fragment represented as a
  polling-based queuing system. The achievable channel bandwidth, the average end-to-end
  delays, and the average number of packets on the individual routes are selected
  as the main performance metrics.
